# Functions-in-JavaScript

This repository is about the different ways that you can write functions in JavaScript.

## The problem:

This is a simple web app that demonstrates how one can write functions in JavaScript in alot of different ways, each with their own unique way of achieving the same goal.

### 1. Common method:

The first method is by using function functionName(parameters) {code}. This function takes a string and reverse it.

### 2. Function expressions:

The second way of using functions is called Function expressions, and works like this:
const varName = function(parameters) {code}. In This way the function is declared as a variable. This function checks if a string is a palindrome (a string that is the same as when it is reversed).

### 3. Arrow functions:

An Arrow function is a quick way in which you can write a short function. It works like this: const varName = (parameters) => code

## How this has changed my perspective of IT and programming in general:

In programming there is alwais multiple different ways of achieving the same goal, this short web app shows how JavaScript can achieve the same thing (executing functions) in multiple different ways. This changed my perspective because in university you learn one method, but there is always different and new ways to achieve the same thing. Goes to show you the IT world is ever changing.
